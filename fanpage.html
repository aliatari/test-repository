        <h2>Bio</h2>
            
            <p>While the band itself was led by Adam Horovitz, it was Adam Yauch (pictured left), a practicing Buddhist, who steered the band away from their 'Brat Pack' image and towards activism and charitable causes. He created the Milarepa Fund, a non-profit organization devoted to Tibetan independence. With the help of band mates Adam Horovitz and Michael Diamond they played several benefit concerts relating to this cause, including the 1994 Tibetan Freedom Concert. </p>
